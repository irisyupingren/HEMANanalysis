# HEMANanalysis
HEMAN dataset analysis for ICMPC 2018

HEMAN is a dataset derived from an experiment where 12 participants were asked to annotate musical patterns in six pieces. 

## Instructions of the experiment:
“Please, analyze the following musical excerpts and mark all the musical motives you can find. 

A musical motive is defined as a short musical idea, a salient recurring figure, musical fragment, or succession of notes that has some special importance in or is characteristic of a composition. 

It shouldn’t be longer than a musical phrase. 

If you find a motive that is similar to another (or multiple versions of a motive), choose the one that you think is the most representative. 

Even though all motives are relevant, please rate each one of them from 1 to 3: 
1 = Not as relevant 
2 = Relevant 
3 = Highly relevant 

You can listen to the music excerpts as many times as you like. You can find them here. http://urinieto.com/NYU/Research/MotivesExperiment/ ”
